Random effects are a critical part of modern (and even not-so-modern) statistical analysis. A random effect lets you account for non-independence inherent in your experimental structure (nested plots, repeated observations, etc.). Consequently, using random effects properly will not only increase the predictive power of your models, it is fundamental to one of the most universal statistical assumptions: independence. This workshop was presented alongside a "chalk talk" for a lab meeting at the Cornell University Sustainable Cropping Systems Lab.
