Today we will be using a subset of data published in Menalled et al. (2023): <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43987-x>

This experiment looks at changes in weed communities across 10 cover crop treatments (5 summer cover crop treatments, 5 winter cover crop treatments). Today, we will just work with winter cover crops (i.e. tilled control, canola, cereal rye (CR), hairy vetch (HV), and HV x CR mix).

```{r Data, echo = T, results = 'hide'}
#Each year is stored separately, I'll load them in, calculate total weed biomass, and combind the dataframes
WintData1_tmp <- read.csv("https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/adb24a0c-0b2c-4bd6-90ad-e203c270bba3/content")
WintData2_tmp <- read.csv("https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/f05bf7b9-3c15-48ec-9f28-0c978cf0560b/content")

str(WintData1_tmp) #loaded in nicely
str(WintData2_tmp) #loaded in nicely

#We don't want to do weed community analysis today, just simple models of total weed biomass
WintData1 <-
  WintData1_tmp %>% 
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(WeedBiomass = sum(c_across(-c(Trial, Year, Site, Block, Plot, CoverCrop, CoverCropBiomass, canola, 
                                       cereal.rye, hairy.vetch)), na.rm = FALSE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(Year, Site, Block, Plot, CoverCrop,WeedBiomass)

WintData2 <-
  WintData2_tmp %>% 
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(WeedBiomass = sum(c_across(-c(Trial, Year, Site, Block, Plot, CoverCrop, CoverCropBiomass, canola, 
                                       cereal.rye, hairy.vetch)), na.rm = FALSE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(Year, Site, Block, Plot, CoverCrop,WeedBiomass)

#Combine data frames
WintData_tmp <- bind_rows(WintData1,WintData2)

WintData <- WintData_tmp %>% mutate(across(-WeedBiomass, as.factor))
str(WintData) #looks good!
```

#Modeling

I want to see how weed biomass is impacted by cover crop treatment, basically WeedBiomass\~CoverCrop. However, my experiment has clear nesting! I must account for non-independence through a model with more fixed and/or random effects. Looking at my experimental design (picture below) we can see that there are **three** *total* levels.

1.  Site and Year are at an equal level because both sites are in both years and visa versa. there are 2 levels of each site and year

2.  Block is within Site and Year. I know this because we used different fields in each site year, so block 1 in Musgrave during year 1 **is not** the same as block 1 in Musgrave during year 2. Because each block is within a unique site year, there are 2 sites x 2 years x 4 blocks = 16 groups.

3.  Cover crop treatments are within blocks, this is the level at which I made my observations.

As nice it would be to account for Site and Year through a random effect, we don't have enough levels of either group. Remember we need at least three groups per variable for it to be a random effect. Thus, these variables will be fixed effects. On the other hand, site.year has 4 groups (iffy, but let's just try) and block has 16 levels across site-years (nice, that's a solid amount of groups for a RE). As for CoverCrop, this is the level of observation, it does not need to be a random effect.

![Here is a nice picture of the map and experimental design of the data we are working with today](Example_MapDesign.png){width="452"}

```{r}
#create Site.Year variable
WintData$Site.Year <- paste(WintData$Site,WintData$Year,sep = ".")
WintData$Site.Year <- as.factor(WintData$Site.Year)


#let's get a sense of what we are working with...
#We'll probably be working with a Tweedie glmer because 
plot(WeedBiomass~1, data = WintData) #a cluster of points with near zero weed biomass, probably 
plot(WeedBiomass~CoverCrop*Site*Year, data = WintData) #non-normally distributed around treatments

#let's get modeling

#simple lmer first
WeedBio_Mod1 <- lmer(WeedBiomass~Site*Year + CoverCrop + (1|Site.Year/Block), data = WintData)
#singularity issues from RE of Block:Site.Year = 0, could be okay if anova DF are good
summary(WeedBio_Mod1) #RE captured correctly because number of groups in RE follows design
plot(WeedBio_Mod1) #terrible, as expected
check_model(WeedBio_Mod1) #I'm mainly interested in pp_check (looks bad) and random effects check (looks okay)

anova(WeedBio_Mod1) #while numerator DF look good, denominator degrees of freedom are 0, this comes from the singularity and is WRONG 
anova(WeedBio_Mod1, ddf = "Kenward-Roger") #numerator AND denominator DF look good. Denominator df are all less then measurement number (80 plots) so good. If I added some predictor variable at a higher level then, it would have to have less denominator degrees of freedom than it's replication (i.e. if soil type was only across site.year.block, then its DenDF should not be more than 16)

#now glmer
WeedBio_Mod2 <- glmmTMB(WeedBiomass~Site*Year + CoverCrop + (1|Site.Year/Block),
                        family = tweedie(link = "log"),
                        data = WintData)
summary(WeedBio_Mod2) #RE captured correctly because number of groups in RE follows design
simulateResiduals(WeedBio_Mod2, plot = TRUE) #much better, good enough to publish
check_model(WeedBio_Mod2) #pp_check still shows some error around 0. All RE look good. Good enough!
car::Anova(WeedBio_Mod2, type = 3) #unfortunately only car::Anova is possible for glmmTMB. but no singularity warning, so I feel good 
```
