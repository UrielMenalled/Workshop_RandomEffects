Today we will be using a subset of data published in Menalled et al. (2023): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43987-x

This experiment looks at changes in weed communities across 10 cover crop treatments (5 summer cover crop treatments, 5 winter cover crop treatments). Today, we will just work with winter cover crops (i.e. tilled control, canola, cereal rye (CR), hairy vetch (HV), and HV x CR mix).

Here is a nice picture of the map and experimental design of the data we are working with today
